====================
WHAT IS SPRING BOOT?
====================

Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easier to create and run Java applications.

Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It is designed to simplify the development of new Spring applications by providing defaults for configuration and a variety of out-of-the-box functionalities that speed up the development process.

### Key Features of Spring Boot

1. **Auto-Configuration**:
   - Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project. For example, if you include the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency, Spring Boot will automatically configure a web application with Tomcat and Spring MVC.

2. **Standalone Applications**:
   - Spring Boot applications can be run as standalone applications from the command line using `java -jar`. They come with an embedded web server (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), so you don’t need to deploy them to an external server.

3. **Production-Ready Features**:
   - Spring Boot includes features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration to help you build and run your applications in production environments.

4. **Opinionated Defaults**:
   - Spring Boot follows an opinionated approach to configuration, providing sensible defaults to reduce the need for manual setup. This helps developers get started quickly.

5. **Spring Boot Starters**:
   - Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors you can include in your application. For example, the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` starter includes dependencies for Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and the H2 database.

6. **Spring Boot CLI**:
   - The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to run and test Spring Boot applications from the command line. It can be used to quickly prototype with Groovy scripts.

### Benefits of Using Spring Boot

- **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Spring Boot reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to set up a Spring application.
- **Rapid Development**: The framework’s auto-configuration and starter dependencies help you get started quickly.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Spring Boot is commonly used to develop microservices due to its simplicity and ease of deployment.
- **Embedded Servers**: No need to install or configure an external server; you can run your application with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless integration with the Spring ecosystem and other popular libraries and tools.



============================
WHY SPRING BOOT OVER SPRING?
============================

Spring Boot offers several advantages over the traditional Spring framework, particularly in terms of simplifying and accelerating the development process. Here are the key reasons why developers often choose Spring Boot over Spring:

### 1. **Auto-Configuration**

**Spring Boot**:
- Spring Boot can automatically configure many aspects of your application based on the dependencies included in your project.
- Reduces the need for extensive XML or Java-based configuration, allowing you to get started quickly with minimal setup.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Requires explicit configuration using XML files or Java classes with `@Configuration` annotations.
- More setup and boilerplate code are required to get a basic application running.

### 2. **Embedded Servers**

**Spring Boot**:
- Comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow.
- Allows you to run applications as standalone jar files using `java -jar`, eliminating the need to deploy to an external application server.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Typically requires deployment to an external application server like Tomcat or Jetty.
- Additional steps are needed to package and deploy the application.

### 3. **Starter Dependencies**

**Spring Boot**:
- Provides starter dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-*`) that aggregate commonly used libraries and frameworks, simplifying dependency management.
- Reduces the need to manually specify versions and compatibility of various dependencies.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Requires manual management of dependencies, including version compatibility.
- Developers need to add and configure each dependency individually.

### 4. **Production-Ready Features**

**Spring Boot**:
- Includes built-in support for monitoring, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- Provides production-ready features with minimal setup, making it easier to manage and monitor applications in production environments.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Requires additional libraries and configuration to achieve the same level of monitoring and management.
- More manual effort is needed to set up production-ready features.

### 5. **Spring Boot CLI**

**Spring Boot**:
- Offers a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to run and test Spring Boot applications using Groovy scripts.
- Facilitates rapid prototyping and development without the need for a full-fledged Java IDE.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Does not have a dedicated CLI for rapid application development.
- Typically requires a full development environment setup.

### 6. **Simplified Deployment**

**Spring Boot**:
- Simplifies deployment with its embedded servers and single executable JAR/WAR files.
- Supports Docker and cloud-native deployments out-of-the-box, making it easier to containerize and deploy applications in modern cloud environments.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Often involves more complex deployment processes, including packaging and configuring external servers.
- Requires additional setup for containerization and cloud deployments.

### 7. **Microservices Architecture**

**Spring Boot**:
- Well-suited for building microservices due to its lightweight nature, ease of configuration, and built-in support for RESTful services.
- Integrates seamlessly with Spring Cloud, which provides tools for building robust microservices architectures.

**Traditional Spring**:
- Can be used for microservices, but requires more manual configuration and setup.
- Lacks the streamlined approach provided by Spring Boot for quickly setting up and managing microservices.

### Conclusion

Spring Boot is preferred over traditional Spring for its ability to simplify development, configuration, and deployment processes. It reduces boilerplate code, provides sensible defaults, and offers a comprehensive set of tools and features that streamline the creation of production-ready applications. This makes Spring Boot an excellent choice for modern application development, particularly when speed and simplicity are critical.



============================
WORKING OF SPRING BOOT?
============================

Spring Boot starts by scanning the starter dependency in pom.xml
Then download and auto-configure the module included in pom.xml



============================
HOW SPRING BOOT STARTS?
============================

Starts by calling main() method of your main class.
The run() method of SpringApplication is called. This method starts the application by creating an application context and initializing it.
Once the application context is initialises, the run() method starts the application's embedded web server.



============================
TOP SPRING BOOT ANNOTATIONS
============================

@Bean
In Spring Boot, the @Bean annotation is used to declare a method as a bean definition that Spring will manage and create an instance of. Beans are objects that form the backbone of a Spring application and are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

@SpringBootApplication: It combines three annotations: 
@Configuration: ,
-> Indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions
-> When you annotate a class with @Configuration, it tells Spring that this class contains one or more methods annotated with @Bean which should be invoked to instantiate and configure new objects (beans) managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
-> This is particularly useful for defining beans in a centralized way, especially for beans that are complex or need specific construction logic.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: 
-> Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings
-> It simplifies Spring configuration by automatically configuring beans that are likely needed based on the libraries present in the project.
-> For example, if you have the spring-boot-starter-web dependency in your project, @EnableAutoConfiguration will configure necessary beans for a web application, like a DispatcherServlet, a ViewResolver, and more.
-> It reduces the need for explicit bean configuration in many common cases.

@ComponentScan: 
-> Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the specified package
-> By default, @ComponentScan scans the package of the class that declares this annotation.
-> You can specify base packages to scan by providing the basePackages attribute.

@Component: 
-> The @Component annotation is used to mark a Java class as a Spring component. Spring will automatically detect these classes through classpath scanning and register them as beans in the application context.
-> It is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. You can use it to annotate classes that perform a variety of tasks in your application, and Spring will recognize and manage these classes as beans.

@Autowired: 
-> The @Autowired annotation in Spring Boot is used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring-managed bean. This feature is a core part of the Spring Framework's Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) mechanisms.
-> By using this annotation, you let Spring manage the lifecycle and dependency graph of your beans, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability.

@Service: 
-> The @Service annotation in Spring Boot is used to indicate that a class is a "service" class, which typically contains business logic. It is a specialization of the @Component annotation, which means that the class annotated with @Service is also a Spring bean and will be automatically detected through classpath scanning.

@RestController: 
-> @RestController in Spring Boot is like a special tool we use to create web services, particularly for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It helps us send and receive data between different software systems over the internet.
-> It's used to indicate that the data returned by the methods of the annotated class should be directly written to the HTTP response body as JSON/XML/any other type of response body content instead of relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the output.
-> @RestController is particularly useful when you're building RESTful web services or APIs where the response is often JSON or XML data rather than HTML for human consumption. It saves you from explicitly annotating each method with @ResponseBody in such cases.

@Controller: 
-> The primary purpose of a controller in a Spring MVC application is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients and generate an appropriate response. These requests typically correspond to user actions, such as clicking a link, submitting a form, or making an AJAX call.
-> Controllers typically contain methods annotated with @RequestMapping (or other variants like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.). These annotations define the URL patterns that the controller method can handle. For example, a method annotated with @GetMapping("/products") would handle GET requests to the "/products" URL.
-> When a request comes in, the DispatcherServlet examines the URL and consults the request mappings defined in the registered controllers. If it finds a matching mapping, it delegates the request to the corresponding controller method for processing.
-> Controller methods typically return a ModelAndView object or a String representing the view name. The model contains data to be displayed by the view, while the view is responsible for rendering the response to the client.
-> In Spring Boot applications, controllers are automatically discovered and registered as beans, thanks to the auto-configuration provided by Spring Boot. You can simply annotate your controller classes with @Controller and define request mappings to handle HTTP requests.

@RequestMapping:
-> @RequestMapping is a Spring annotation used to map web requests to specific handler methods in Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux applications. It is used to define the URL pattern that a controller method will handle. 
-> In Spring Boot, which builds upon the Spring framework, @RequestMapping is commonly used in RESTful web services to define the endpoints of the API.
-> Starting from Spring 4.3, you can use more specific annotations instead of @RequestMapping. For example:
   @GetMapping for GET requests
   @PostMapping for POST requests
   @PutMapping for PUT requests
   @DeleteMapping for DELETE requests

@Repository: 
-> In Spring Framework, @Repository is an annotation used at the class level to indicate that the class provides mechanisms for storage, retrieval, search, update, and delete operations on objects. 
-> It is typically used to annotate classes that access the database or any other type of persistence mechanism.



==================================
WHAT ARE THE SPRING BOOT STARTERS?
==================================

-> Starters are a collection of pre-configured dependencies that make it easier to develop particular kinds of applications.
-> These starters include all of the dependencies, version control, and configurations needed to make certain features of Spring Boot application functional.



=============================================
WHAT ARE THE KEY DEPENDENCIES OF SPRING BOOT?
=============================================

-> spring-boot-starter-parent
-> spring-bbot-maven-plugin
-> spring-boot-starter-test
-> spring-boot-starter-web
-> spring-bbot-starter-security



=============================================
WHAT IS spring-boot-starter-parent?
=============================================

-> Spring Boot Starter Parent is a starter project that provides the default configuration for spring based application.
   - The dependency management feature manages the versions of common dependencies.
   - Provide the default compiler level as Java 1.8 and UTF-8 source encoding.
   - Provides a default configuration for maven plugin.



==================================================
WHAT IS SPRING BBOT CLI AND WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS?
==================================================

-> Command line tool to create, run and manage spring boot Applications.

spring version
spring help
spring init
spring help init
spring init --list

spring init -d web cli-project



==================
WHAT IS THYMELEAF?
==================

-> Java based server-side templating engine used in Java web applications to render dynamic web pages.



====================================
WHAT IS IOC OR INVERSION OF CONTROL?
====================================

-> Inverting the control of creating object using new keyword to container or framework.



=============================
EXPLAIN SPRING BEAN LIFECYCLE
=============================

-> Bean - Plain Old Java Object
-> Spring Bean lifecycle is maintained by IOC container.
   1. Container gets started
   2. Container creates object of the bean as per request.
   3. Dependencies is created.
   4. Dependencies is injected.
   5. Destroyed when container is closed.
   
In Spring Boot, the `@Bean` annotation is used to declare a method as a bean definition that Spring will manage and create an instance of. Beans are objects that form the backbone of a Spring application and are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

When you annotate a method with `@Bean`, Spring will execute that method and register the return value as a bean in the Spring ApplicationContext. These beans are usually used to define configurations, dependencies, and other components in a Spring application.

### Key Features of `@Bean`:
1. **Custom Bean Creation**: It allows you to define your own bean creation logic for objects that are not automatically created by Spring.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Beans can be automatically injected into other beans using annotations like `@Autowired`.
3. **Scope Management**: You can specify the bean’s scope (`singleton`, `prototype`, etc.) using the `@Scope` annotation along with `@Bean`.
4. **Initialization and Destruction Methods**: You can specify methods that should be called after the bean is created or before it is destroyed.

### Example:
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```
In this example, the method `myService()` is annotated with `@Bean`, meaning that Spring will create and manage an instance of `MyServiceImpl` and make it available as a bean in the application context.

You typically use `@Bean` when you need fine control over how an object is instantiated or when third-party library components need to be integrated into your Spring-managed code.
