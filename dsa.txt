Certainly! Here are multiple-choice questions covering the conversions between infix, postfix, and prefix notations, along with their answers:

### Questions

41. **What is the postfix notation for the infix expression  A + B X C ?**
    - A)  AB + C X 
    - B)  ABC X + 
    - C)  A + BC X 
    - D)  A X B + C 
41. **B)  ABC X + ** - In postfix notation, the operator follows the operands.

42. **Convert the infix expression  (A + B) X (C + D)  to prefix notation.**
    - A)  A + B X C + D 
    - B)  X + A B + C D 
    - C)  + X A B X C D 
    - D)  + A B X + C D 

To convert the infix expression (A + B) X(C + D) to prefix notation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the main operator**:
   - The main operator here is `×` which separates the two parts of the expression: `(A + B)` and `(C + D)`.

2. **Convert each part to prefix notation**:
   - The infix expression `A + B` converts to `+ A B` in prefix notation.
   - The infix expression `C + D` converts to `+ C D` in prefix notation.

3. **Combine the results with the main operator**:
   - The entire expression `(A + B) X(C + D)` in prefix notation would place the main operator `×` before its two operands, which are the prefix notations of `A + B` and `C + D`.

Thus, combining these parts, the prefix notation of (A + B) X(C + D) is `× + A B + C D`.

### Answer

42. **B)  X + A B + C D ** - Convert each part to prefix and then combine.

43. **What is the infix notation for the postfix expression  AB + CD X - ?**
    - A)  (A + B) - (C X D) 
    - B)  (A + B) X (C - D) 
    - C)  (A X B) - (C + D) 
    - D)  (A - B) + (C X D) 
43. **A)  (A + B) - (C X D) ** - Convert postfix to infix.

To convert the postfix expression \( AB + CD \times - \) to infix notation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the postfix notation**:
   - Postfix notation requires reading the operands first and then the operators in the order they are applied.

2. **Convert postfix to infix**:
   - Start from the beginning of the postfix expression and work backward:
     - \( AB + \) converts to \( (A + B) \)
     - \( CD \times \) converts to \( (C \times D) \)
     - \( - \) indicates subtraction

3. **Combine the converted parts**:
   - From the postfix expression \( AB + CD \times - \), we convert to infix notation as follows:
     - \( AB + \) converts to \( (A + B) \)
     - \( CD \times \) converts to \( (C \times D) \)
     - Combine these with the subtraction operator \( - \) in between.

Therefore, the infix notation for the postfix expression \( AB + CD \times - \) is \( (A + B) - (C \times D) \).

### Answer

**A) \( (A + B) - (C \times D) \)**

44. **Convert the infix expression  A X (B + C) - D  to postfix notation.**

45. **What is the prefix notation for the infix expression  (A + B) / (C - D) ?**
    - A)  / + A B - C D 
    - B)  + A B / C - D 
    - C)  / A + B - C D 
    - D)  + / A B - C D 
45. **A)  / + A B - C D ** - Convert each part to prefix and then combine.

46. **Convert the postfix expression  ABC X + DE -  to infix notation.**
    - A)  (A + B) X C - D + E 
    - B)  (A X B + C) - (D + E) 
    - C)  ((A + (B X C)) - (D - E)) 
    - D)  A + (B X (C - D)) + E 
To convert the postfix expression \( ABC \times + DE - \) to infix notation, we can use the following approach, which involves using a stack to help manage operators and operands:

### Step-by-step Conversion

1. **Read each symbol from left to right** in the postfix expression.

2. **Use a stack** to temporarily hold operands and operators as we build the infix expression.

3. **Process each symbol**:
   - If the symbol is an operand (like \( A, B, C, D, E \)), push it onto the stack.
   - If the symbol is an operator (like \( +, \times, - \)):
     - Pop the necessary number of operands from the stack to construct the infix expression.
     - Combine the operands and the operator in the correct order to form the infix expression segment.
     - Push this resulting expression back onto the stack.

### Applying the steps to the postfix expression \( ABC \times + DE - \):

- Start with an empty stack.
- Process each symbol:

   - **A**: Push \( A \) onto the stack.
   - **B**: Push \( B \) onto the stack.
   - **C**: Push \( C \) onto the stack.
   - **\(\times\)**: Pop \( C \) and \( B \) from the stack, construct \( B \times C \), push \( B \times C \) back onto the stack.
   - **+**: Pop \( A \) and \( B \times C \) from the stack, construct \( A + (B \times C) \), push \( A + (B \times C) \) back onto the stack.
   - **D**: Push \( D \) onto the stack.
   - **E**: Push \( E \) onto the stack.
   - **-**: Pop \( E \) and \( D \) from the stack, construct \( D - E \), push \( D - E \) back onto the stack.

- After processing all symbols, the stack should contain the final infix expression.

### Final Infix Expression

From the steps above, the final infix expression corresponding to the postfix expression \( ABC \times + DE - \) is \( (A + (B \times C)) - (D - E) \).
